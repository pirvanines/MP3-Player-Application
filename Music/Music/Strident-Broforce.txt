Deep inside the jungle, in the shadow of the war
There rises a sinister evil
The people live in fear, under a tyrant’s reign of terror
Who will save us now?

From out of the darkness and into the fight
Broforce is coming to set things to right

Broforce!
Kicking ass for justice and for liberty
For freedom and the flag
They’re the final stand
The last band of heroes
Who’ll fight terror with no remorse...

Broforce
For Freedom!
Broforce!
For the flag!
Broforce!
For liberty and justice for all!

Satan’s forces are amassing
But they’ll never take our freedom
We call on the defenders; on the red, white, blue avengers
To liberty or death

Feliz Navidad

Broforce
For Freedom!
Broforce!
For the flag!
Broforce!
For liberty and justice for all!

In the darkest hour
In the eye of the storm
We stand together
An unbreakable force of bros!

Broforce!
Kicking ass for justice and for liberty
For freedom and the flag
They’re the final stand
The last band of heroes
Who’ll fight terror with no remorse...
Broforce!
